# BOBPE Website Repository

This repository supports the development and maintenance of the **BOBPE (Bot-Based Personalized Education)** website and related public-facing materials for my professional portfolio.

BOBPE is a framework for using AI as a leverage point to support efficient, human-centered, personalized education at scale. This repository houses the artifacts that support communicating that vision, including website content, static assets, and supporting documentation.

---

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- Store content and assets used on the BOBPE website
- Develop and version HTML, CSS, and related front-end code
- Maintain written materials describing projects, philosophy, and values
- Provide a lightweight, transparent record of how the site evolves over time

This repository is **not** intended to be a monolithic application or production deployment. It serves as a working space for organizing, drafting, and iterating on public-facing materials.
