# BOBPE  
## BOt-Based Personalized Education for Productivity Enhancement

This repository houses the content and supporting materials for the **BOBPE** professional portfolio website. BOBPE is an initiative focused on leveraging bot-based technologies to enable scalable personalized education and productivity enhancement, grounded in learning science and motivated by Bloom’s 2-Sigma problem.

The repository is organized to support both human-readable website content and future programmatic use (e.g., static site generation, content reuse, or AI-assisted workflows).

The following directories are included for continuity and future expansion, but are **not currently surfaced** on the public website:

- `projects/buffalo/`
- `projects/pollenators/`
- `projects/charge/`

These represent broader research or organizational frameworks that will be incorporated once they are more fully developed or externally documented.

---

## Notes on Usage

- Markdown files in `website/content/` are the **canonical source of truth** for website copy.
- PDFs, images, and raw READMEs are included for reference and provenance.
- The structure is designed to support:
  - Manual copy/paste into Google Sites
  - Future static site generation
  - Programmatic content extraction or AI-assisted reuse

---

## Status

BOBPE is an active, evolving initiative. Projects range from classroom deployments to research prototypes and public-facing outreach. Each project page documents its scope, audience, and maturity level.

*This repository reflects an ongoing effort to align advances in AI with established learning science, enabling more human-centered, personalized education at scale.*
