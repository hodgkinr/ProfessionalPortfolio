# AI Literacy Workshops, Community Talks, and Podcasts

## Project Summary

The AI Literacy Workshops, Community Talks, and Podcasts initiative focuses on helping educators, parents, students, and community members build confidence and fluency with modern AI systems. Rather than emphasizing technical depth or abstract theory, these engagements are designed to demystify AI, clarify its capabilities and limitations, and empower participants to use AI tools thoughtfully and responsibly.

This work supports the BOBPE mission by extending bot-based personalized education beyond formal courses and into broader community and professional contexts.

## Educational Problem Addressed

Public conversations around AI are often dominated by fear, hype, or oversimplification. Many educators and parents feel unprepared to engage with AI tools or to guide students in their use, leading either to avoidance or uncritical adoption.

This initiative addresses the need for:
- Practical, approachable AI literacy
- Clear explanations of what AI is and is not
- Hands-on experience with real tools
- Frameworks for responsible and transparent use

---

## Workshop and Talk Design Philosophy

These sessions are built around several core principles:

- **Confidence over expertise**  
  Participants do not need technical backgrounds to meaningfully engage with AI.

- **Use before theory**  
  Hands-on interaction precedes abstract explanation, lowering barriers to entry.

- **Critical engagement**  
  Participants explore AI limitations, bias, hallucinations, and uncertainty alongside capabilities.

- **Human-centered framing**  
  AI is presented as a tool that augments human judgment and creativity, not a replacement.

- **Immediate applicability**  
  Sessions emphasize what participants can do today, not speculative futures.
