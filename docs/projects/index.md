# BOBPE Projects

This page provides an overview of the projects that make up the **BOBPE (BOt-Based Personalized Education for Productivity Enhancement)** ecosystem. Each project explores how bot-based AI systems can support personalized learning, feedback, and instructional productivity while remaining grounded in learning science and human-centered pedagogy.

Projects are organized by primary audience, though many span multiple contexts.

## For Students

[Concept Inventory & Socratic Tutor Bots](concept-inventory-bots/concept-inventory-bots.md)

Interactive AI tutors designed to transform concept inventories from static assessments into formative learning experiences. These bots engage students in Socratic dialogue to surface misconceptions, prompt reflection, and support conceptual change.

---

[Code Narration & Interview Review Platform](code-narration-platform/code-narration-platform.md)

A platform that helps students practice explaining and reasoning about code, mirroring authentic technical interview and code review scenarios. AI-assisted feedback emphasizes understanding, clarity, and metacognition rather than code production alone.

---

[Computing & Engineering in the Age of AI](comp-eng-age-of-ai/comp-eng-age-of-ai.md)

A course-level initiative exploring how AI reshapes computing and engineering education. This work focuses on curriculum design, assessment philosophy, and transparent AI integration that prepares students for AI-augmented professional practice.

## For Instructors

[Canvas-Integrated Chatbots](canvas-integrated-chatbots/canvas-integrated-chatbots.md)

AI-powered instructional assistants embedded directly within the Canvas learning management system. These chatbots provide consistent, course-aligned support while preserving instructor control, privacy constraints, and pedagogical intent.

---

[AI-Assisted LaTeX & Lab Report Grading](latex-lab-grading/latex-lab-grading.md)

An AI-assisted grading workflow that supports the evaluation of complex technical lab reports. The system generates editable draft feedback aligned with instructor-defined criteria, enabling scalable, high-quality feedback with human oversight.

---

[AI-Augmented Personalized Feedback](personalized-feedback/personalized-feedback.md)

A feedback-focused system built on the BUFFALO framework that supports individualized, formative feedback across concept inventories, lab reports, and open-ended assignments. Emphasis is placed on understanding, reflection, and instructor review.

---

## For Parents & the Public

[Introduction to Generative AI (Coursera)](coursera/coursera.md)

A public-facing Coursera course designed to build foundational understanding and confidence with generative AI. The course emphasizes conceptual clarity, appropriate use, and accessible explanations for non-specialists.

---

[Local Gemini Chatbot for Parents](gemini-parent-chatbot/gemini-parent-chatbot.md)

A locally deployable AI chatbot designed for AI literacy, exploration, and trust-building. The system prioritizes transparency, privacy, and hands-on engagement for families and community members.

---

[AI Literacy Workshops, Community Talks, and Podcasts](ai-literacy-workshops/ai-literacy-workshops.md)

A collection of workshops, talks, and media appearances focused on demystifying AI and empowering educators, parents, and the public to engage with AI tools confidently and responsibly.

## Notes

- Each project page documents its scope, audience, and deployment status.
- Some projects span multiple audiences and are grouped here by primary use case.
- Broader frameworks such as BUFFALO, POLLENATORS, and CHARGE are maintained in the repository but are not currently surfaced as standalone projects on the website.
